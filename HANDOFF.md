# PIA Project Handoff | Updated: 2026-02-12 | Machine #3 (SODA-YETI)

## NEXT AGENT: READ THIS FIRST

You are on **Machine #3** (`C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\pia-system`).
The PIA server was started this session and should be running.
You should have **Puppeteer MCP** loaded for browser control.

---

## First Actions (Do These Immediately)

1. **Verify Puppeteer MCP tools** are available (puppeteer_navigate, puppeteer_screenshot, etc.)
2. **Check server**: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health`
3. If server is down: `cd C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\pia-system && npm start`
4. **Navigate to** `http://localhost:3000` with Puppeteer
5. **Screenshot** the dashboard and show the user
6. **Act, don't explain** — the user wants to see you controlling things

## What's Built (84% Complete)

Everything works: Fleet Matrix, CLI Tunnel, Command Center, MCPs view, AI Models, Alerts, Agent CRUD, WebSocket real-time, PWA, Auto-Healer, Orchestrator, Discord bot (needs token).

## What Remains

| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| P1 | Discord bot (needs DISCORD_TOKEN) |
| P1 | Persistent chat history |
| P2 | Multi-machine hub/spoke sync |
| P2 | Task queue system |
| P3 | Agent specialization + automated routing |

## User's Style

- Action over explanation
- Wants to SEE browser control
- Types fast with typos — just understand intent
- Calls this "machine #3"
- Likes journals and documentation
