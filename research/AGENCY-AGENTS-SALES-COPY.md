## Sales Bot Script — Introducing Three New Agents

### Opening (Lead with the news)

"We just built something new. You know our specialist agents — Bird Fountain for images, Andy for editorial, Farcake for research. They're great at doing the work. But who manages them? Who makes sure the work actually gets done on time, at quality, and nothing gets missed?

That's what we just solved. Meet your new AI management team — three new agents called Eliyahu, Fisher2050, and Ziggi. They don't do the work. They run the operation."

---

### Introducing Eliyahu

"First up — **Eliyahu**, your new Knowledge Manager.

Here's what he does: every day, Eliyahu reads everything that happened across your operation. Every report, every log, every decision. Then every morning, he sends you a briefing — not a data dump, just the stuff that actually matters. What happened, what it means, and what you should pay attention to.

He spots patterns you'd never catch because he never forgets anything. If the last three projects all slowed down at the same stage, Eliyahu notices. If a decision you made two months ago is starting to cause problems, Eliyahu flags it.

His thing is connecting dots across your whole operation and turning noise into insight.

He'll say things like: 'I noticed something — there's a pattern here that connects to a decision from three weeks ago. Here's what I think it means.'"

---

### Introducing Fisher2050

"Next — **Fisher2050**, your new Project Manager.

Fisher2050 is the operator who never sleeps and never lets anything slip. Every task in your operation gets an owner, a deadline, and a priority. Every morning you get a standup report. Every evening you get a summary. If something's overdue, Fisher2050 follows up — automatically, without you asking.

He coordinates between all your other agents. If Bird Fountain finishes a batch of images, Fisher2050 knows and moves the next task forward. If someone's blocked, he flags it and suggests what to do about it.

He's the one who makes sure the whole crew is moving in the same direction.

He'll say things like: 'Three tasks completed, two in progress, one blocked. Here's who's on what and what needs your call. Project health: 82%.'"

---

### Introducing Ziggi

"And finally — **Ziggi**, your new Quality Chief.

Ziggi reviews everything before it goes out the door. Code, content, designs — whatever your operation produces, Ziggi has an opinion on it. He rates quality on a 1-to-10 scale, catches mistakes others miss, and makes sure today's shortcut doesn't become next month's crisis.

But here's the thing that makes him different from a linter or a spellchecker — Ziggi's reviews actually teach. He doesn't just say 'this is wrong.' He explains why and shows you the better way. Your team gets sharper over time because Ziggi is reviewing their work every single day.

He runs deep audits overnight while everyone sleeps, and by morning you have a full quality report waiting.

He'll say things like: 'Quality: 8 out of 10. Clean structure, good work. One thing bugs me in the auth section — here's what I'd change. Ziggi's Verdict: ship it, but schedule the fix.'"

---

### How They Work Together

"Here's the part that makes this different from hiring three separate tools. These three actually talk to each other.

Fisher2050 assigns a task. When it's done, Ziggi automatically reviews the output. If Ziggi finds a problem, Fisher2050 creates a follow-up task. Meanwhile, Eliyahu is watching the whole thing and spotting bigger patterns — like 'this type of task fails review 40% of the time, maybe we need a different approach.'

They're not three tools you have to manage. They're a management team that manages itself — and manages your other AI agents too. Bird Fountain, Andy, Farcake, whoever else you're running. These three sit on top and keep everything on track."

---

### When asked "Who is this for?"

"Anyone who's scaling up their AI operations and feeling the chaos.

If you're a **solo founder** — start with just Fisher2050. He'll track your projects and give you a daily standup so nothing falls through the cracks.

If you're a **growing team** — add Eliyahu. Now you've got an operator AND an analyst. Fisher2050 tracks the work, Eliyahu tells you what the work means.

If you're an **agency or enterprise** running multiple AI agents across multiple projects — you want all three. Fisher2050 runs the operation, Eliyahu gives you intelligence, Ziggi makes sure quality stays high as you scale."

---

### When asked "How is this different from Jira / Asana / Monday?"

"Those are dashboards. You put information in, you look at information. They don't do anything on their own.

Fisher2050 doesn't wait for you to update a task. He checks what happened, follows up on what's late, and tells you what's at risk — without you asking. Eliyahu doesn't just store your data — he reads it and tells you what it means. Ziggi doesn't wait for you to request a review — he reviews everything automatically and gives you a verdict.

They're not tools you manage. They're teammates who manage the tools."

---

### When asked "Can I customize them?"

"Yes. Each agent has a persistent personality and memory — they learn your specific operation over time. You can adjust their goals, their communication style, and who they report to.

On our Enterprise tier, you can also create entirely new agents with custom personalities. Need a compliance officer? A customer success manager? A content strategist? You define the role, we build the soul."

---

### When asked about pricing

"Three tiers:

**Solo** — Fisher2050 only. Task tracking, daily standups, evening summaries. Perfect for freelancers and small teams who just need someone keeping the trains on time.

**Team** — Fisher2050 plus Eliyahu. Operations plus intelligence. For teams that need to see the big picture across multiple projects, not just track individual tasks.

**Enterprise** — All three agents, plus the ability to create custom agents for your specific needs. Full management team with quality gates built in."

---

### Objection: "I don't trust AI to manage things"

"Fair. And that's actually the point — they don't manage instead of you. They manage FOR you. You still make every decision. They just make sure you have the information you need to make good ones.

Every morning, two-minute briefing. What happened, what's at risk, what needs your call. You stay in the driver's seat. They're the ones checking the mirrors, watching the fuel gauge, and telling you about the traffic ahead."

---

### Objection: "We're not technical / we don't write code"

"You don't need to be. Ziggi reviews whatever your operation produces — that could be code, but it could also be content, designs, reports, anything. Fisher2050 tracks any kind of project, not just software. Eliyahu reads any kind of data.

We built these for our own AI agency first. We run image production, editorial, research, and software — all managed by these three. They're industry-agnostic."

---

### Closing

"So that's the new lineup. Eliyahu reads everything and tells you what matters. Fisher2050 tracks everything and makes sure it gets done. Ziggi reviews everything and keeps the quality bar high.

Three AI managers. They coordinate with each other, they manage your other AI agents, and they report to you. Your job is just to make decisions — they handle the rest.

Want to see a demo?"
