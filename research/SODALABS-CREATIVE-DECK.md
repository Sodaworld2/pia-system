# SodaLabs — Creative Pitch Deck
### "You Don't Need More People. You Need a Better Team."
**Created by Claude Opus 4.6 | February 14, 2026**
**For:** Investors, partners, clients, internal alignment

---
---

## SLIDE 1 — THE COVER

# SodaLabs

**Meet Your AI Workforce**

*Not assistants. Not chatbots. Employees.*

---
---

## SLIDE 2 — THE UGLY TRUTH

# Running an agency is a staffing nightmare.

| The Problem | The Number |
|-------------|-----------|
| A senior specialist costs you | **$80,000/month** |
| Training them takes | **6 months** |
| They spend this much time on admin | **40%** |
| They work this many hours per day | **8** |
| They quit after | **18 months** |

You're not running a creative agency. You're running an HR department that occasionally does creative work.

---
---

## SLIDE 3 — THE OBVIOUS ANSWER (THAT DOESN'T WORK)

# "Just use AI."

Everyone says this. Here's what they actually mean:

**ChatGPT** — You type. It responds. You type again. It forgets everything tomorrow.

**Copilot** — It autocompletes your sentences. Cool. You still did the work.

**"AI Agents"** — A chatbot with a to-do list. Breaks if you look at it wrong.

None of these are employees. They're fancy search bars with personality disorders.

---
---

## SLIDE 4 — WHAT IF

# What if your AI actually showed up for work?

Not "responded when prompted."
Not "generated some text."

Actually showed up. Knew the project. Remembered last week. Had opinions. Did the work. Reported back. Went home. Came back tomorrow and picked up where it left off.

What if you could hire an AI team that works like a real team?

---
---

## SLIDE 5 — THAT'S US

# SodaLabs builds AI employees.

Not tools. Not plugins. Not chatbots.

**Autonomous specialists** that:
- Have persistent memory (they remember last month)
- Have real personalities (not "helpful assistant" — actual character)
- Work on schedules (2am reviews, 6am briefings, 9am standups)
- Coordinate with each other (without you in the middle)
- Get better at your business over time

We don't sell you a prompt. We give you a team.

---
---

## SLIDE 6 — THE LINEUP: SPECIALISTS

# The Workers

These do the job.

---

### BIRD FOUNTAIN — Your Design Department
**Status: Live**

Produces images at scale. Not one image at a time — production runs. Campaign assets, social batches, creative variations. The kind of output that requires a 4-person design team, handled by one agent that never asks for a brief twice.

*Built for: Agencies, museums, creative studios*

---

### WINGSPAN — Your Presentations Expert
**Status: Live**

Tracks your pitch decks in flight. Knows which version went to which investor, what changed, what landed. Every founder has 14 versions of the same deck in a folder called "FINAL_v3_REAL." Wingspan ends that.

*Built for: Sales teams, founders*

---

### ANDY — Your Editorial Machine
**Status: Building**

Takes content from research to publication — in your voice. Not generic blog-post-generator voice. YOUR voice. Andy learns how you write and produces drafts that sound like you stayed up until 3am writing them yourself.

*Built for: Thought leaders, content teams*

---

### FARCAKE — Your Research Engine
**Status: Building**

Pulls from multiple sources, cross-references, and gives you the actual answer — not 10 blue links. Farcake doesn't search. Farcake investigates.

*Built for: Researchers, strategists, decision-makers*

---
---

## SLIDE 7 — THE LINEUP: MANAGERS

# The Management Team

These run the operation.

**This is what nobody else has.**

You can find AI tools that write. AI tools that design. AI tools that research. But who manages the AI? Who makes sure it actually ships on time, at quality, without you babysitting?

That's our management layer. Three agents. They coordinate with each other, manage the workers, and report to you.

---

### ELIYAHU — Knowledge Manager
*"I noticed something..."*

Reads every log, every report, every decision across your entire operation. Every morning, you get a briefing — not a data dump, the three things that actually matter today. He connects dots across projects you'd never think to compare. He tracks whether the decisions you made last month are actually working.

**You wake up. You read a two-minute briefing. You know everything.**

---

### FISHER2050 — Project Manager
*"Project health: 82%."*

Tracks every task, every deadline, every person responsible. If something's late, he follows up — automatically, without you nagging anyone. Morning standup. Evening summary. If Bird Fountain finishes a batch, Fisher2050 moves the next task. If someone's blocked, he flags it before you even notice.

**Nothing falls through the cracks because someone is always checking the cracks.**

---

### ZIGGI — Quality Architect
*"Ziggi's Verdict: 8/10. Ship it."*

Reviews everything before it goes out the door. Rates quality 1-to-10. Catches the mistake your tired eyes missed at 11pm. But here's the thing — Ziggi doesn't just say "this is wrong." He explains why and shows the better way. Your whole team gets sharper because Ziggi is teaching every single day.

Runs deep audits at 2am while everyone sleeps. By morning, full quality report.

**Your quality bar stays high even when you're scaling fast.**

---
---

## SLIDE 8 — HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

# It's not three tools. It's a team.

```
You give Fisher2050 a goal
    │
    ├── Fisher2050 breaks it into tasks
    │   assigns them to workers (Bird Fountain, Andy, etc.)
    │
    ├── Workers do the work
    │
    ├── Ziggi automatically reviews the output
    │   flags issues, rates quality
    │
    ├── If Ziggi finds a problem →
    │   Fisher2050 creates a follow-up task
    │
    ├── Meanwhile, Eliyahu is watching everything
    │   "This type of task fails review 40% of the time.
    │    Maybe we need a different approach."
    │
    └── You get a morning briefing
        with everything that matters
```

**You made one decision. Five things happened. Nobody asked you a question.**

That's what a team does. That's what we built.

---
---

## SLIDE 9 — THE PLATFORMS

# The Infrastructure

Our agents don't float in space. They work through real platforms.

---

### GUMBALL CMS — Publish From WhatsApp
**Status: Live**

Your team lives in WhatsApp. Your CMS should too. Send a message, it becomes a post. Approve from chat, it goes live everywhere. No dashboard, no login, no "let me find the publish button."

---

### SODACAST — AI-First Live Broadcast
**Status: Building**

Turns passive viewers into active participants. AI bots manage the event in real-time — audience interaction, content routing, gamification. Every broadcast becomes a two-way conversation.

---

### CLIPAISLE — Crowd-Powered Production
**Status: Building**

Every phone in the crowd becomes a camera. Multi-angle broadcasts from smartphone footage, stitched and produced automatically. Post-event content portal included.

---

### VIKI — Interactive Kiosks
**Status: Live**

AI-powered video kiosks for retail, museums, brand activations. Not a screen playing a video. An intelligent display that responds, adapts, and engages every person differently.

---
---

## SLIDE 10 — THE SECRET WEAPON

# We run our own agency on this.

This isn't theoretical. We didn't build AI tools and hope someone figures out how to use them. We built them because **we needed them**.

SodaLabs runs its own creative agency — images, content, research, software — all managed by the same AI team we're selling to you.

Eliyahu sends US a morning briefing.
Fisher2050 tracks OUR deadlines.
Ziggi reviews OUR code at 2am.
Bird Fountain produces OUR client assets.

**We eat our own cooking. Every day.**

That's why the product works. It wasn't designed in a lab. It was forged in the chaos of actually running a business.

---
---

## SLIDE 11 — BEHIND THE CURTAIN

# PIA — The Operating System

Everything runs on PIA (Project Intelligence Agent).

**What it does:**
- Controls 43+ agents across multiple machines
- Mission Control dashboard — see everything, control everything
- Persistent memory — agents remember across sessions
- Cost-optimized routing — uses free local AI when possible, paid API when needed
- Multi-machine fleet — your AI team runs on your hardware, not ours
- Real-time terminal streaming — watch agents work live
- Security layer — intrusion detection, rate limiting, audit trails

**What it means for you:**
You get a control room. One screen. Every agent, every project, every cost, every output. Live. You see what's working and what isn't. You intervene when you want to — or you don't, and it runs itself.

---
---

## SLIDE 12 — THE SOUL SYSTEM

# Every agent has a soul.

Not a prompt. A **soul**.

Seven layers:

| Layer | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Identity** | Name, role, email, purpose | They know who they are |
| **Personality** | How they talk, think, react | They feel like a real person |
| **Goals** | What they're trying to achieve | They have direction |
| **Relationships** | Who they work with and how | They collaborate naturally |
| **Rules** | What they can and can't do | They stay safe |
| **Memory** | What they remember | They get smarter over time |
| **Schedule** | When they work | They show up on time |

A chatbot forgets you existed 5 minutes ago.
Our agents remember the decision you made three months ago — and whether it worked.

---
---

## SLIDE 13 — THE MATH

# Let's talk money.

### The Old Way: Hire Humans

| Role | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Project Manager | $12,000 |
| Content Strategist | $10,000 |
| Designer (x2) | $16,000 |
| QA / Editor | $8,000 |
| Research Analyst | $9,000 |
| **Total** | **$55,000/month** |

Plus: Benefits. Office. Training. Turnover. Sick days. Timezone limitations.
Hours of operation: 8am-6pm, Monday-Friday.

### The New Way: SodaLabs AI Team

| Agent | Role | Hours |
|-------|------|-------|
| Fisher2050 | Project Manager | 24/7 |
| Andy | Content Strategist | 24/7 |
| Bird Fountain (x2 instances) | Design Production | 24/7 |
| Ziggi | QA / Quality Review | 24/7 |
| Farcake | Research Analyst | 24/7 |
| Eliyahu | Knowledge / Insights | 24/7 |
| **Total** | **Full team** | **168 hrs/week** |

No benefits. No office. No turnover. No sick days. No timezone.
Starts in hours, not months.

We're not saying fire your people. We're saying **your people should be doing the work only humans can do** — strategy, relationships, creativity, judgment. Let AI handle the rest.

---
---

## SLIDE 14 — THE TIERS

# How To Start

### SOLO — $___/month
Fisher2050 only. Daily standups. Task tracking. Evening summaries.
For freelancers and solo founders who need one reliable operator.

*"I just need someone making sure I don't drop balls."*

### TEAM — $___/month
Fisher2050 + Eliyahu. Operations plus intelligence.
For growing teams who need to see patterns across projects.

*"I need to know what's working and what isn't, across everything."*

### ENTERPRISE — $___/month
All three managers + specialist agents + custom souls.
For agencies running multiple clients and AI workers at scale.

*"I need to run a 50-person operation with a 5-person team."*

### CUSTOM — Let's Talk
Your industry. Your workflows. Your agents. We build the team.

---
---

## SLIDE 15 — THE LEARNING SIDE

# We Also Teach This

### Soda Academy
Everything we learned building AI agents, packaged into courses. Not theory. The actual techniques we use every day.

### SodaColab
Hands-on workshops. We sit with your team and build your AI workforce together. Not a webinar — a lab.

**Why this matters:** The companies that learn to build and manage AI teams now will own the next decade. The ones that wait will be hiring from the ones that didn't.

---
---

## SLIDE 16 — THE VISION

# The Future of Work Isn't Humans Using AI.
# It's Humans Managing AI Teams.

Today you manage 5 employees.
Tomorrow you'll manage 50 AI agents and 5 humans.

The humans do strategy, relationships, and creative judgment.
The AI handles execution, production, analysis, and operations.

**SodaLabs is building the team — and the operating system to run them.**

We're not building another AI tool.
We're building the first AI workforce company.
