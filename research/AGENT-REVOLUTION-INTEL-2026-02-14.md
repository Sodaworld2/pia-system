## The Big Picture (February 2026)

The AI agent ecosystem is in a Cambrian explosion. Multi-agent systems have gone from experimental to production-grade. Anthropic launched Agent Teams, a $100K hackathon drew 13,000+ applicants, and a Google principal engineer confessed Claude Code replicated a year of her team's work in one hour.

## 6. WHAT WORKS vs WHAT DOESN'T

### Works
- Rapid prototyping, parallel exploration, specialized sub-agents
- CLAUDE.md as memory, task decomposition, git-based locking

### Doesn't Work
- Memory/continuity (resets each session)
- Reliability at scale (same task = different results)
- Code review bottleneck (+91% review time)
- Shared file editing (conflicts)
- 80-90% pilot death rate

### Productivity Paradox
- METR study: devs *believed* 24% faster but were 19% *slower*
- Anthropic report: AI in 60% of work, only 0-20% fully delegated
- URL: https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/

## 7. APPLE XCODE + MCP STANDARD
- **URL:** https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/
- Integrates Claude Agent SDK AND OpenAI Codex
- MCP as interop standard — legitimizes entire category

## 8. PIA STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### PIA Advantages
1. Web dashboard (competitors are TUI/terminal)
2. Real-time WebSocket streaming
3. 4 approval modes (Manual/Auto/Yolo/Plan)
4. File checkpointing
5. Cross-machine hub-spoke architecture
6. DAO governance layer

### Should Add
1. Agent Teams integration
2. MCP protocol support
3. Multi-model (Claude + Codex + Gemini)
4. `includePartialMessages` for live streaming
5. Docker sandbox isolation
6. Agent memory across sessions
7. Real productivity metrics
